==========================================================================================================================================

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple storage manager - a module that is capable of reading blocks from a file
on disk into memory and writing blocks from memory to a file on disk. The storage manager deals with pages (blocks) of fixed size
(PAGE_SIZE=4096 bytes). In addition to reading and writing pages from a file, it provides methods for creating, opening,
and closing files. The storage manager has to maintain several types of information for an open file: The number of total pages in
the file, the current page position (for reading and writing), the file name, and a POSIX file descriptor or FILE pointer.

1) testWriteBlock(); -->
   Create file, open page, write data in 1st page, write data in 2nd page
    - Check if total pages in page -1 has got updated or not
    - Read block 0 and check if value returned is same as what was written. Do the same for block 1

14) testReadFirstBlock();
    Create file, open file, write data in file 1, write data in file 2
    Close file, open file
    Call readFirstBlolck();
     -Page 1 should be returned.

==========================================================================================================================================

SM_FileHandle has information about the currently open file. It holds information about the file name, total number of pages,
current page position and a file pointer. SM_PageHandle is a pointer to an area in the memory from which data will be written to
the file or the memory to which data is written from a file. The first page of the file is reserved for maintaining
booking information : totalNumPages. Page indexes start from 0. The storage manager only deals with pages (blocks) of fixed
size (4096 bytes). The application is single threaded. Read and write operations can be performed only after opening the file
till user closes it. Read and write operations work only on valid file and page position.

1) createPageFile :
   For the first time user needs to create a file before performing any further operations on it. A file with two pages
   will be created and totalNumPages is set to 1. We have stored "totalNumPages" at the first page (bookkeeping page position -1),
   and the actual data exposed to user starts from second page(page postion 0) which currently is filled with '\0' bytes.
   On success it returns RC_OK, if the file already exists it fails with RC_FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS.

2) openPageFile :
   User needs to open the file after which he can perform any number of read and write operations before he closes it.
   On file open we save the details of the file( file name, file pointer, totalNumPages and curPagePos) in SM_FileHandle.
   CurPagePos will be set to 0, and totalNumPages will be set to the value stored in the file.
   On success it returns RC_OK, if the file does not exist it fails with RC_FILE_NOT_FOUND.

3) closePageFile :
   On close operation, the underlying file will be closed and the values in SM_FileHandle will be deinitialised.
   User can no longer perform read/write on the file until he opens it again.
   On success it returns RC_OK, if the file does not exist it fails with RC_FILE_NOT_FOUND.

4) destroyPageFile :
   On destroy operation, the file is removed.
   On success it returns RC_OK, if the file does not exist it fails with RC_FILE_NOT_FOUND.

5) readBlock :
   Read operation is allowed only if the file or page number are valid(-1 upto totalNumPages-1) and file is open. All read operations return a
   page (4096 bytes) of data. After read curPagePos is updated to the page position which was currently read.
   On success it returns RC_OK. It can fail with RC_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_INIT (invalid file), RC_READ_NON_EXISTING_PAGE(invalid page number),
   RC_READ_FAILED (file seek or read operation failure).

6) getBlockPos:
   If the file is valid, return curPagePos of the file.
   On success it returns RC_OK. If file is not valid it fails with RC_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_INIT.

7) readFirstBlock :
   It reads the first block (pagePostion =0 ) from the file. Everything else is same as readBlock.

8) readPreviousBlock :
   It reads the block previous to the curPagePos (pagePostion = curPagePos-1 ) from the file. Everything else is same as readBlock.

9) readCurrentBlock :
   It reads the current block (pagePostion = curPagePos) from the file. Everything else is same as readBlock.

10) readNextBlock :
    It reads the block next to the curPagePos (pagePostion = curPagePos+1 ) from the file. Everything else is same as readBlock.

11) readLastBlock :
    It reads the last block (pagePostion = totalNumPages-1) from the file. Everything else is same as readBlock.

12) writeBlock :
    Write operation is allowed only if the file and page number are valid and file is open. A page is valid if it is an existing page, or a new page
    appended to the end. ie., if the file currently has 3 pages, write is allowed for page position 0,1,2 (The old data in this page is
    replaced with the new data) and 3 (in this case the totalNumPages is updated to 3 and a new page with the input data is appended to the file.
    All write operations write a page (4096 bytes) of data. After write, curPagePos is updated to the page position which was currently written.
    On success it returns RC_OK. It can fail with RC_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_INIT (invalid file), RC_WRITE_NON_EXISTING_PAGE(invalid page number),
    RC_WRITE_FAILED (file seek or write operation failure).

13) writeCurrentBlock :
    Writes the data into the curPagePos of the file(pagePos = curPagePos). Everything else is same as writeBlock.

14) appendEmptyBlock :
    This operation is allowed if the file is valid and open. A new page with '\0' bytes is appended to the end of the file. TotalNumPages is
    incremented by 1 both in SM_FileHandle and the bookkeeping page of the file. CurPagePos will be set to the newly appended page position.
    On success it returns RC_OK. It can fail with RC_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_INIT (invalid file), RC_WRITE_FAILED (file seek or write operation failure).

15) ensureCapacity :
    This operation is allowed only if the file is valid and open. If the required number of pages already exist, it doesnt do anything,
    else it will append the required number of pages with '\0' bytes into the file. Update totalNumPages to the new size in both SM_FileHandle and
    the bookkeeping page of the file. Updates curPagePos to the last page appended.
    On success it returns RC_OK. It can fail with RC_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_INIT (invalid file), RC_WRITE_FAILED (file seek or write operation failure).
